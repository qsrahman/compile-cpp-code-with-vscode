# A Minimalist build system for C++ projects

Currrently I am using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) development. One problem that I faced was that every new project need a configuration to compile/build/run it in vscode. It was too much of a hassel to compile a small project using vscode's tasks etc. The solution I came up with can be used for any new project by just copying and renaming this folder and you are good to go. There is no need to change the Makefile etc. When building the project use `cmd + shift + p` and choose appropriate option. Note that I am using [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/), the Makefile etc may need some changes for other operating systems.

Happy coding!
